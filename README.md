-interface description:
The water bottle screen is designed to run from the top to the bottom of the side of the bottle. It has been designed to have limited interactivity since my intention is for it to be mostly read-only. This is to the user avoid accidently pressing the buttons when carrying or washing their smart bottle. The bottle displays the time and date, battery percentage, daily hydration intake, and water temperature. The only setting that can be changed directly from the water bottle is the temperature, while other settings that are less likey to be changed often can be found in the mobile app. The mobile app settings include the user's health settings that determine their daily hydration goal and the bottle cleaning status. When the user updates their weight and age group, their daily hydration goal will be calculatedand updated in both the mobile app and on the water bottle screen. The bottle clean status displays whether the bottle is dirty or clean. After a certain period of time, the status will switch from "Clean" to "Dirty!". The user must click the reset button once they wash their bottle to return it to the clean status. The time period is currently only 10 seconds so the functionality can be demonstrated, but would preferable be a week for a real use-case.<img width="295" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43217465/196067768-01a664c2-4aa9-4342-a89c-715df9af9e45.png">
